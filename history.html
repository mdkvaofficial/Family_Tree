           After Prophet Nuh AS...

        </b>
    </h6>
    <p class="lead">
        The Kayanis, according to historical accounts, trace their lineage back to Manuchehr, who was the son of Aeraj. Aeraj, in turn, was the son of Fareedoon, continuing through a lineage that includes Jamshaid, Taihooras, Hoshingh, Siamik, Kiumars, Armakhsh, Yafiz, and finally, Nuh (Noah). This lineage places them as descendants of Nuh (AS), making them part of the broader Iranian tribes with a significant historical and genealogical connection.

            The Beginning...

        </b>
    </h6>
    <p class="lead">
        The Kayani tribe has a rich history rooted in rulership and migration across Iran. Their lineage, beginning from Nuh (AS), reflects their enduring presence and influence in Iranian history. Over time, they have moved between regions, seeking and establishing rule wherever they settled. Today, many Kayanis reside prominently in Saistan, Iran, enjoying a prosperous lifestyle. Notably, periods like that of King Bohraam Gor and King Noshairwaan are celebrated as golden eras in Kayani history, highlighting their legacy of bravery and fairness in leadership.

           Conquered Tibbat, China!

    </h6>

    <p class="lead">
        The Kayani tribe's historical significance extends to their rule over Iran before their later ventures into Tibet. Their legacy is preserved in artifacts, including crowns displayed in the Museum of Iran. In Iran, the Kian tribe, also known as Kayanis, embodies their lineage and cultural heritage. During the eighth generation after Noshairwaan, Sultan Kaid distinguished himself through his courage and bravery, notably leading the tribe's first successful expedition into Tibet and establishing a reign that spanned seven generations. His leadership marked a pivotal chapter in Kayani history, characterized by valor and strategic prowess.

    </h6>

    <p class="lead">In the lineage following Sultan Kaid, the Kayanis continued their legacy of rulership with notable figures like Sultan Qaab, who governed Kashmir. This era marked a significant period in Kashmir's history under Kayani rule, extending from Sultan Qaab through to Sultan Rustam Khan. Sultan Rustam Khan, the last of the Kayani rulers in Kashmir, left a lasting legacy by naming the region "Rustam Naggar" in honor of his reign. This historical narrative underscores the Kayani tribe's enduring influence and governance across different regions, shaping the cultural and political landscape of Kashmir during their rule. </p>

            Gakhars, the Name and Religious Conversion!

        </b>
    </h6>
    <p class="lead">Under Sultan Mahmood Ghaznavi's rule, the Potohar region saw significant transformation as it transitioned into an Islamic state. This period marked a pivotal moment when many Fire-Worshippers (Zoroastrians) embraced Islam, contributing to the cultural and religious landscape of the region. The descendants and army of Gakhar Shah, under whom the area came to be known as Gakhars, played a prominent role in these historical developments, shaping the identity and history of the Gakhar tribe in Potohar. </p>

                Current Scenario...
          
        </b>
    </h6>
    <p class="lead">The rule of the Kayani tribe, particularly through Gakhar Shah, marks the beginning of their influence over the Potohar region. Over time, the Gakhars became synonymous with the area, playing a significant role in its governance and history. However, their rule eventually faced challenges, particularly during conflicts with the Sikhs, which led to their eventual decline and loss of power. Despite this, the Gakhars had a lasting impact, having ruled over parts of India for approximately 765 years, leaving behind a legacy linked with the rich tapestry of South Asian history.</p>
