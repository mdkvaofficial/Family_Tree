		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			The Gakhars, also known as Kayani Gakhars, are a historically
			significant warrior tribe predominantly found in the Potohar Plateau
			region of Punjab, Pakistan. They have played a crucial role in the
			region's history, particularly during the medieval period. The
			Gakhars are known for their military prowess and were influential
			rulers in areas surrounding Rawalpindi, Taxila, and modern-day
			Islamabad.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Origin</h1>
		<p>
			The Gakhar tribe traces its origin to ancient Persian nobility, and
			they claim descent from the Kayanian dynasty, an ancient line of
			Persian kings. The title "Kayani" refers to the legendary Kayanian
			rulers of Iran, believed to have been powerful monarchs in
			pre-Islamic Persia. According to their tradition, they were invited
			to the Potohar region by local rulers to assist in defense against
			invaders, after which they settled in the area.

		<h1>Culture</h1>
		<p>
			The culture of the Gakhars reflects a blend of Persian and
			Indo-Islamic influences, shaped by their warrior ethos and tribal
			traditions. Key aspects of Gakhar culture include:
		</p>
		<ul class="culture-list">
			<li>
				<strong>Warrior Tradition:</strong> The Gakhars have a strong martial
				tradition, with much of their identity centered around warfare, defense
				of their territories, and loyalty to their allies.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Language:</strong> The Gakhars speak Punjabi with a Potohari
				dialect, and many are bilingual in Urdu.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Tribal Hierarchy:</strong> The Gakhars have historically
				maintained a tribal leadership structure, where power passed through
				a hierarchy of chiefs or leaders, often referred to as Maliks or
				Sardars.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Customs:</strong> Traditional Gakhar customs include elaborate
				wedding ceremonies, respect for elders, and communal decision-making
				through tribal councils.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Religion</h1>
		<p>
			The Gakhars are predominantly Muslim and follow Sunni Islam. Their
			conversion to Islam is believed to have occurred during the early
			Islamic conquests in the Indian subcontinent, around the 8th-10th
			centuries. Like many tribes in the region, their religious practices
			are intertwined with their tribal identity and local Sufi
			traditions.
		</p>

		<p>
			They hold Sufi saints and shrines in high regard, often
			participating in Urs (death anniversaries of Sufi saints) and other
			religious gatherings.
		</p>

			Punjab, Pakistan. This region includes the areas surrounding
			Rawalpindi, Jhelum, Taxila, Attock, and Chakwal. Historically, their

			Islamabad. The region is known for its rolling hills, plains, and
			strategic location between the Himalayas and the plains of Punjab.
